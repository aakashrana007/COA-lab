### COA-lab

This repository contains all the programs developed and executed during the Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) lab sessions. Each lab session focuses on a fundamental concept related to binary arithmetic and its applications in computer systems.

# Lab Sessions
**Lab 1: Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary**
This lab session covers the conversion between binary and decimal number systems. It includes:

Converting a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
Converting a decimal number to its binary equivalent.


**Lab 2: Unsigned Binary Addition**
This lab session focuses on performing addition operations on unsigned binary numbers. The program handles:

Binary addition with proper carry handling.


**Lab 3: Unsigned Binary Subtraction**
This lab session deals with the subtraction of unsigned binary numbers. It covers:

Binary subtraction using the borrow concept.


**Lab 4: Binary Multiplication**
This lab session involves the multiplication of binary numbers. It includes:

Binary multiplication algorithm.
Handling of partial products and summation.


**Lab 5: Binary Division - Restoring and Non-Restoring Algorithm**
This lab session explains the division of binary numbers using two different algorithms:

Restoring Division Algorithm
Non-Restoring Division Algorithm
